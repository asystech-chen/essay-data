This is the raw data from the BIO206 scientific paper.
Here's what you can do:
bam: mapping result;
ddump_fasta: FASTA file after deduplication;
original_fasta: The original fasta file is from GtRNAdb;
ser-fasta: deduplicates and retains only serine-only fasta files;
ser-fasta-ref: serine fasta file for reference sequences used for mapping, deduplicated and removes duplicate sequences that use the same codon;
tree &orthofinder: Results of IQ-TREE and OrthoFinder.
